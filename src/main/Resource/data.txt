The Netherlands has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 60 times since making its debut as one of the seven countries at the first contest in 1956, and has missed only four contests so far. Twice because the dates coincided with Remembrance of the Dead (1985, 1991) and twice because of not being allowed to participate due to bad results of the year before (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in 1958, 1970, 1976, 1980 and will host the contest in 2020.
The Netherlands has won the contest five times, with Corry Brokken in 1957, Teddy Scholten in 1959, Lenny Kuhr in a four-way tie in 1969, Teach-In in 1975, and Duncan Laurence in 2019; the country also finished last in 1958, 1962, 1963, 1968, and last in the semifinal in 2011. The Netherlands finished fourth with Sandra & Andres (1972), third with Mouth & MacNeal (1974), fifth with Maggie MacNeal (1980), fifth with Marcha (1987), fourth with Edsilia Rombley (1998) and second with The Common Linnets (2014).
After the introduction of the semifinals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, the record of the contest, but have reached every Grand Final since then except in 2015.
The Netherlands, presented in the contest as "The Netherlands",[4] has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 59 times since making its debut as one of the seven countries competing in the very first contest in 1956. It has missed only four contests so far (1985, 1991, 1995 and 2002). The preselection process was often done through the Nationaal Songfestival, with the winner qualifying to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest. The Netherlands has won the contest five times.
With five victories, the Netherlands ranks in the top 10 most successful Eurovision countries. The country's first two victories came in the 1950s, with Corry Brokken in 1957 and Teddy Scholten in 1959. The 1960s was a mostly unsuccessful decade for the country, the exception was in 1969, when Lenny Kuhr won a third title for the Dutch with "De Troubadour", winning in a four-way tie with France, Spain and the UK. Sandra & Andres finished fourth in 1972 and Mouth & MacNeal were third in 1974, before Teach-In achieved the Netherlands fourth victory in 1975 with Ding-A-Dong. The Netherlands best result of the 1980s was fifth, achieved by both Maggie MacNeal (of Mouth & MacNeal) in 1980 and Marcha in 1987. In the 1990s, Ruth Jacott, with sixth place in 1993 and Edsilia Rombley, with fourth in 1998, achieved the Netherlands best results of the decade. The Netherlands have finished last in the contest final on four occasions, in 1958, 1962, 1963 and 1968. They also finished last in the semi-final in 2011.
Since the semi-finals were introduced in 2004, the Netherlands has reached the final on six occasions, failing to reach the final for eight years in a row, from 2005–2012. Opting for an internal selection has fared well for the Netherlands since 2013, when Anouk became the first Dutch entry in nine years to qualify for the final, where she finished ninth. In 2014, another internal selection proved to be a success, when country duo The Common Linnets, made up of members Ilse DeLange and Waylon, became the Netherlands' most successful entry since 1975, placing second. The Netherlands once again qualified for the final in 2016 (with Douwe Bob) and 2017 (with O'G3NE), finishing 11th both times, and in 2018 (with Waylon), finishing 18th. In 2019, Duncan Laurence achieved the Netherlands fifth victory in the contest.
The Netherlands has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest four times: in 1958, 1970, 1976 and 1980. The first three times were after winning the previous year, while the 1980 contest was staged in the Netherlands, after Israel (who had won in 1979) declined to organize the event for a second consecutive year. Similarly, the Netherlands had declined the right to organize the 1960 contest, as they had hosted the event just two years previously. The Netherlands is appointed to host the 2020 edition of the contest, following Duncan Laurence's win at the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv, Israel, with his song "Arcade".
The Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The first one was at the 1985 contest, held in Gothenburg, Sweden. The contest, held on 4 May conflicted with the Dutch Remembrance of the Dead and therefore the Netherlands withdrew.[5]
In 1991 the contest was again held on 4 May, and so the Netherlands withdrew for the same reason as six years earlier.[6]
There was no Dutch participation in the 1995 and 2002 contests, due to relegation as a result of the country's poor showings in the previous year.
The Netherlands did compete in 2000. But at 22:00 (UTC+2) on Saturday 13 May, the broadcast was cancelled because of the Enschede fireworks disaster which happened a few hours before.[7] The points awarded by the Netherlands were taken from the back-up jury vote, as there was no televote after the program was cut short.
